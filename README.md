# FlappyBirdUNO

My fork of [FlappyBird](https://github.com/mattleibow/FlappyBird) repo. The main goal to adapt the code to .NET 1.4 standard / Xamarin Forms 2.5 .

## About
The "official" FlappyBird clone - made with SkiaSharp

## Status

- NET Standard 1.4
- WIn10/11 Desktop/Mobile semi-compatible (UWP; min.os. build 15063; touch control damaged)
- Game process not complete

## Architecture
It is built with a few technologies:
 - UWP "multi-platforming"
 - SkiaSharp 1.60 (All attempts to use 1.68/2.40 failed)
 - Xamarin.Forms 2.5
 - Uno Platform (remained for future deals)
